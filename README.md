# Cheapamine (Dopamine, but for iPhone's with cheap aftermarket screens in mind)

## Sometimes when you jailbreak, Sileo will not appear, to fix this, you have to open settings in Cheapamine and press Refresh Jailbreak Apps.

### If anyone knows how to fix this issue, please let me know.

A rootless semi-untethered jailbreak for iOS 15.0 - 16.5.1 (arm64e) and iOS 15.0 - 16.6.1 (arm64).
